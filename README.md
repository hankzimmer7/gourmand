# Gourmand

* Deployed at https://le-gourmand.herokuapp.com/

## Description

Gourmand has two main purposes:

* One is to allow users to search for a specific food dish (e.g. Chicken & Waffles) and see what nearby restaurants serve that dish, as well as user reviews for the dish (with reviews being specific to the version of the dish served at that restaurant).

* The second is to allow users to view the menus of nearby restaurants and see how other users have rated each dish on the menu.
